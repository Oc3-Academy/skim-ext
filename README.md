# Skimpy Extended

A light weight tool for creating summary statistics from dataframes.

This is a replica of the original Skimpy package, but for polars!

**skimpy** is a light weight tool that provides
summary statistics about variables in data frames within the console or your interactive Python window.
Think of it as a super-charged version of `df.describe()`.
[You can find the documentation here](https://aeturrell.github.io/skimpy/).
